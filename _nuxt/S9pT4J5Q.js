The process is industrial, standardized, and infinitely repeatable. Yet the resulting profile — a linear module — carries within it a remarkable tension between constraint and possibility. </p><p> The die determines the form. But the form, once liberated from the die, enters a space of radical openness. It can be cut, joined, anodized, bent, stacked, and assembled into configurations that the die never anticipated. The extrusion&#39;s identity shifts with each new context: structural member, furniture leg, heat sink, decorative trim, artistic medium. </p><h2 class="mt-12 font-serif text-2xl font-semibold text-catalog-text">Material Philosophy</h2><p> This catalog reflects a specific philosophical position: that material&#39;s form and function are contextual attributes, not inherent properties. When an aluminum extrusion is removed from its intended architectural application and placed in a gallery, it doesn&#39;t lose its &quot;aluminum-ness&quot; — but it gains new registers of meaning. The industrial profile becomes a readymade. The structural member becomes a module in a visual system. The commodity becomes a conceptual unit. </p><p> This process of decontextualization and re-assembly is not unique to aluminum. It operates across materials and scales — from Duchamp&#39;s urinal to Serra&#39;s weathering steel, from Nakashima&#39;s figured walnut to El Anatsui&#39;s compressed bottle caps. In each case, the material carries a biography that inflects its artistic present. </p><h2 class="mt-12 font-serif text-2xl font-semibold text-catalog-text">Catalog Structure</h2><p> The 100 works in this catalog are organized across eight categories, each representing a distinct territory where industrial material meets artistic intention. The categories are not mutually exclusive — many works could belong to several — but they provide navigational structure for a fundamentally rhizomatic collection. </p><p> More important than the categories are the connections between works. Each entry maps relationships to other works in the catalog: material affinities, conceptual parallels, direct influences, formal similarities, shared processes. These connections can be explored through the interactive force-directed graph on the Connections page. </p><h2 class="mt-12 font-serif text-2xl font-semibold text-catalog-text">Methodology</h2><p> Every entry includes a critical description (200-300 words), a personal relevance note connecting it to the catalog&#39;s material philosophy, source citations from established publications, and mapped connections to related works. Sources include museum collection pages, Dezeen, Designboom, Frieze, Artforum, e-flux, academic journals, and gallery publications. </p></div>',3)),e("div",x,[e("div",null,[e("p",g,s(i(a).length),1),t[0]||(t[0]=e("p",{class:"mt-1 text-xs text-catalog-muted"},"Cataloged Works",-1))]),t[2]||(t[2]=e("div",null,[e("p",{class:"font-serif text-3xl font-bold text-catalog-text"},"8"),e("p",{class:"mt-1 text-xs text-catalog-muted"},"Categories")],-1)),e("div",null,[e("p",f,s(i(n)),1),t[1]||(t[1]=e("p",{class:"mt-1 text-xs text-catalog-muted"},"Mapped Connections",-1))])])]))}});export{k as default};
