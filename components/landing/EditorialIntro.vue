          The aluminum extrusion profile is a paradox: endlessly standardized yet infinitely
          configurable. Pushed through a die at industrial scale, the resulting cross-section
          becomes a vocabulary unit — a linear module awaiting context.

          This catalog maps 100 works across the territories where industrial material
          meets artistic intention. From Donald Judd's anodized aluminum stacks to
          El Anatsui's compressed bottle caps, from Sol LeWitt's modular systems to
          Kengo Kuma's joinery translations — each work interrogates what happens when
          material is stripped of its original function and re-assembled into new meaning.
        </p>
        <p>
          The connections between works reveal shared processes, material affinities,
          and conceptual parallels that cut across traditional art-historical categories.
          Navigate them through the catalog or explore the force-directed connections map.
